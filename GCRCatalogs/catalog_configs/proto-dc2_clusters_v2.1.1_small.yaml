    This is a cluster catalog of the galaxies found in ProtoDC2. Galaxies are grouped by 
    host cluster, and cluster properties derived from the underlying dark matter simulations
    are present in this catalog. ProtoDC2 is a down-scaled version of the catalog to be 
    generated for LSST-DESC DC2. For a description of the catalog and the methods, please 
    see https://goo.gl/fXDQwP.
